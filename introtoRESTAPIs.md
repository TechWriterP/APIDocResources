# Introduction to REST APIs
This document contains notes based on the topic [Introduction to REST APIs](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_intro_to_rest_api_doc.html)

## What is an API
- An **API** (or **Application Programming Interface**) provides an interface between two systems.
- APIs are often _pulling_ and _pushing_ data underneath user interfaces.

## APIs that use HTTP protocol are “web services”
- A **web service** is a web-based application that provides resources in a format consumable by other computers.
- All APIs that use **HTTP** protocol as the transport format for requests and responses are considered web services.
- Web services include various types of APIs, including both **REST** and **SOAP** APIs.
- Web services are basically _request-and-response_ interactions between **clients** and **servers** (a computer requests a resource, and the web service responds to the request).
- Web services are language agnostic.
